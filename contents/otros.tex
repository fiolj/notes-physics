\begin{enumerate}
\item Could we try to implement a method for partial differential equations on a non-regular grid  by converting the equations first? The idea is to use the Fourier transform method (see for instance /usr/share/doc/xmds-1.6.5/xmds_doc_20080226.pdf, chapter 2, page 89). This is used in 3D when the chosen coordinates are spherical $(r,\theta,\phi)$.
