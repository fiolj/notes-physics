  issn = {0953-4075}, 
  abstract = {Atomic stabilization is a highlight of superintense laser-atom
      physics. A wealth of information has been gathered on it; established
      physical concepts have been revised in the process; points of contention
      have been debated. Recent technological breakthroughs are opening exciting
      perspectives of experimental study. With this in mind, we present a
      comprehensive overview of the phenomenon. We discuss the two forms of
      atomic stabilization identified theoretically. The first one,
      {``}quasistationary (adiabatic) stabilization{''} (QS), refers to the limiting
      case of plane-wave monochromatic radiation. QS characterizes the fact that
      ionization rates, as calculated from single-state Floquet theory, decrease
      with intensity (possibly in an oscillatory manner) at high values of the
      field. We present predictions for QS from various forms of Floquet theory:
      high frequency (that has led to its discovery and offers the best physical
      insight), complex scaling, Sturmian, radiative close coupling and R.
      -matrix. These predictions all agree quantitatively, and high-accuracy
      numerical results have been obtained for hydrogen. Predictions from non-
      Floquet theories are also discussed. Thereafter, we analyse the physical
      origin of QS. The alternative form of stabilization, {``}dynamic
      stabilization{''} (DS), is presented next. This expresses the fact that the
      ionization probability at the end of a laser pulse of fixed shape and
      duration does not approach unity as the peak intensity is increased, but
      either starts decreasing with the intensity (possibly in an oscillatory
      manner), or flattens out at a value smaller than unity. We review the
      extensive research done on one- dimensional models, that has provided
      valuable insights into the phenomenon; two- and three-dimensional models
      are also considered. Full three-dimensional Coulomb calculations have
      encountered severe numerical handicaps in the past, and it is only
      recently that a comprehensive mapping of DS could be made for hydrogen. An
      adiabatic variation of the laser-pulse envelope keeps the system in the
      Floquet state associated with the initial state, that allows calculation
      of the ionization probability in terms of the corresponding rate. A
      nonadiabatic variation can excite other Floquet states, either discrete
      ({``}shake- up{''}) or continuous ({``}shake- off{''}), with considerable consequences
      for DS. A unitary interpretation of these aspects of DS is presented in
      terms of {``}multistate Floquet theory{''}. We then comment on the points of
      contention raised in connection with DS. Further, we review the extent to
      which the classical approach has been successful in describing DS. We next
      examine the concern that nonrelativistic (NR) predictions for
      stabilization may be inadequate in superintense fields, because
      relativistic corrections would invalidate them. It turns out that,
      although the relativistic corrections do limit stabilization, there is an
      ample {``}window{''} of intensities for which the NR predictions remain valid.
      Finally, we discuss the experimental evidence in favour of stabilization.
      For lack of adequate lasers to study ground states of single-active-
      electron atoms, the experiments so far have been performed on low-lying
      Rydberg states. Two state-of-the-art experiments have determined
      ionization yields for pulses with adiabatic envelopes. Their results
      concur, are in agreement with the theoretical predictions and represent a
      clear-cut confirmation of DS. Our conclusion is that superintense field
      stabilization is firmly established, both theoretically and
      experimentally. Nevertheless, further research is desirable to solve
      interesting open problems, some of which we identify. Their research is
      made timely by the superintense high-frequency light sources that are
      being developed, such as VUV-FELs, or attosecond pulses from high-harmonic
      generation.},

      found to be strongly dependent on both the atomic number and the number of
      electrons in the ion. Several other simple analytic potentials are treated
      in a similar way and it is found that the two-parameter GSZ and Gaspar
      potentials yield energies substantially lower than one-parameter
      potentials of the forms used earlier by Bohr and Tietz.},

      distributions have been calculated for the single-ionization collision
      reactions H$^{+}$, p{\={}}, He$^{2+}$, C$^{4+}$, and C$^{6+}$ + He at 100
      keV/u. The classical trajectory Monte Carlo method has been used with a
      Wigner distribution to improve both the He electron classical radial and
      momentum distributions. Final-state ionized electron momenta are projected
      into a collision plane defined by the initial projectile momentum and the
      final transverse component of the He$^{+}$ recoil momentum, with the
      results displayed differentially in various components of electron and
      recoil momenta. Positively charged projectile impact shows that the soft
      electrons drift with the recoil ion, while higher- energy electrons move
      with the projectile and away from the recoiling target. The electron
      capture to the continuum cusp is present for hard collisions, with
      asymmetry in both the collision plane and along the longitudinal momenta.
      Antiproton impact results in soft electrons drifting backward, away from
      the recoil ion, with the binary-encounter ring clearly observed.},
