notes-physics
=============

These are some notes on a few subjects in physics, intended mainly for private use.

Note that currently is a (very) incomplete set of loosely-related texts on some physics subjects.

The goal is to use it also to learn to produce, readable pdf, web (html) and epub formats of these texts
